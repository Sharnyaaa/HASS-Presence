This is a guide I am writing on the MMWave sensor I have built for my smart home.

It combines 2 physical sensors as well as a bluetooth proxy for presence detection in rooms of my home.

I am in the middle of writing out this guide and will fill it out including a link to the enclosure I designed and the code I am using
