**Please note I am in the middle of writing out this guide and will fill it out including a link to the enclosure I designed and the code I am using**

This is a guide I am writing on the MMWave sensor I have built for my smart home.

It combines 2 physical sensors as well as a bluetooth proxy for presence detection in rooms of my home.

The Components used for this sensor and links to where I got are from, as long as the physical dimentions of the sensors you use are the same then they will fit in the enclosure, do note its a bit of a tight fit inside though.
